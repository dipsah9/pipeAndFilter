Lets study about pipes and filters. 
    Behind the scenes there are lot of processes in our cpu. So how they communicate with each other?
    And most of all why they need to communicate ? Lets say process1 is using some resources for which process 
    is waiting to acquires that resources. So how the process2 will know that process one is done with 
    the resources and its free now. That is where Pipes come in to play. Pipes are used for interprocess
    commnication. And its of following types: 
        1) Anonymous: 
            -Temporary, unidirectional commnication. 
            -Typically used between parent and child process. 
            -Can not be used between unrelated process. 

        2)Names Pipes: 
            - Persistent, bidirectional commnication. 
            - commnication between unrelated process. 
            - Named pipes appear as file in the directory.
