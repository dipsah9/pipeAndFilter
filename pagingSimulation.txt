Scenario for Simulation
    32-bit virtual address:
        Divided into: 
            10 bits for the first-level page table index
            10 bits for the second level page table index
            12 bit for the offset within the pages. 
        This means: 
                Each page has a size of 4KB
                There are 1024 entries in both the first and second-level page

    physical Memory: 
        Reperesented as column of frames. 
        Each frame is 4KB 
    
    Objective: 
        Translate a virtual address to a physical address. 
        simulate two process sharing a physical frame, where one can only and 
        other can read and write.
